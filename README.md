# Robust-Cooling-Load-Prediction
The data and code in this repositiory was the basis to the paper "Lu Chujie, Gu Junhua, Lu Weizhuo. An improved attention-based deep learning approach for robust cooling load prediction: Public building cases under diverse occupancy schedules[J]. Sustainable cities and society, 2023, 96: 104679."

* **RawData**:
  The dataset of the cooling load is generated by EnergyPlus, an open-source building energy simulation program whose results have been widely validated. The five public building types categorized by the Chinese National Standard GB50189-2015 “Design standard for energy efficiency of public buildings” were chosen, including office, hotel, mall, hospital, and school buildings. The cooling loads of five building types are showed in the following figure.

* **TAttenLSTM**
  The main part of the proposed robust prediction method is the deep learning model, attention-based LSTM with Time2Vec (TAttenLSTM). The code is taking the office building as an example.

To be able to run all the models you will need (along with other standard python packages):
  * sckikit-learn
  * keras
  * tensorflow
